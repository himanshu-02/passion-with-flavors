# Chocolate Walnut Brownie Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 80g melted unsalted butter
- 200g condensed milk
- 2-3 drops vanilla essence
- 120g all-purpose flour (maida)
- 30g good quality cocoa powder
- 250g dark chocolate (175g melted and 75g in chunks)
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- Crushed roasted walnuts

## Instructions:

1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 200°C (390°F) and line a 9x9 inch baking tray with parchment paper.

2. **Prepare Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a large bowl, mix melted unsalted butter, condensed milk, and vanilla essence until well combined.

3. **Prepare Dry Ingredients:**
   - In another bowl, sift together all-purpose flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:**
   - Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.

5. **Add Melted Chocolate:**
   - Fold in 175g of melted dark chocolate into the batter.

6. **Transfer to Baking Tray:**
   - Pour the batter into the prepared baking tray and spread it evenly.

7. **Add Toppings:**
   - Sprinkle the remaining 75g of dark chocolate chunks and crushed roasted walnuts on top of the batter.

8. **Bake:** Bake in the preheated oven for 18-22 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs.

9. **Cool and Serve:** Allow the brownies to cool in the tray until warm to touch. Cut into squares and enjoy with a scoop of fresh vanilla ice cream.

Enjoy the rich and fudgy Chocolate Walnut Brownies!
