# Prawns Koliwada Recipe

## Ingredients:
- 500g fresh prawns, cleaned and deveined
- 1 cup gram flour (besan)
- 2 tablespoons rice flour
- 1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 teaspoon red chili powder
- 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- Salt to taste
- Oil for deep frying
- Lemon wedges and onion rings for garnish
- Fresh coriander leaves for garnish

## Instructions:

1. **Marinate the Prawns:**
   - In a bowl, mix together ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala, and salt.
   - Add the cleaned prawns to the marinade and mix well to coat the prawns evenly. Let it marinate for 30 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Batter:**
   - In a separate bowl, combine gram flour (besan), rice flour, salt, and a pinch of red chili powder.
   - Gradually add water to make a thick batter. The consistency should be thick enough to coat the prawns well.

3. **Coat the Prawns:**
   - Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadhai over medium-high heat.
   - Dip each marinated prawn into the batter, ensuring it's coated evenly.
   - Carefully drop the coated prawns into the hot oil. Fry in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
   - Fry until the prawns turn golden brown and crispy. Remove from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain excess oil on paper towels.

4. **Serve:**
   - Garnish with lemon wedges, onion rings, and fresh coriander leaves.
   - Serve hot with mint chutney or your favorite dipping sauce.
